    "deck.gl is an open source library for data visualization on the web. It is designed for large datasets and uses GPU accelerated rendering so interactive visuals stay fast. The main idea is to map data into visual layers like points, lines, text, and polygons, then combine layers to build a complete view. It also supports interaction like picking and highlighting, which makes it useful for maps and dashboards.\n",

    "## 2. What I Found Interesting <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"bullet2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "What I like about deck.gl is how practical it feels. It focuses on making large datasets smooth to explore in the browser, which is harder than it looks. I also like the layer concept because it keeps the workflow clear and modular. To me, this is *a clean example of turning structured data into something people can actually interact with*. The biggest takeaway is **performance and interactivity are treated as first class goals**.\n",

    "- **Core idea:** represent data as a set of visual layers and stack them into one view.\n",
    "- *Typical use case:* interactive maps and dashboards that need to stay responsive with large datasets.\n",
    "- The README is clear and shows results quickly, which makes the project easy to understand.\n",
    "- The project has multiple entry points, including JavaScript, React, and Python via pydeck.\n",

    "In the commit history, the Python script looked familiar because it is plain text code. The Jupyter Notebook looked less familiar because it is saved as a JSON file that includes metadata, cell structure, and sometimes outputs. Because of that, small edits can appear as large changes in the diff even when the visible content did not change much.\n"
