    "This project utilizes convoluted neural networks to train an algorithm that (with enough image input of boss) recognizes the *boss*'s face as distinct from *other* faces. When the boss appears in the camera, the program fetches the image and automatically displays a PyCharm screenshot to hide other tabs on the screen. (I think it's hilarious)\n",

    "* `boss_input.py`: for loading, reading, and extracting images of boss.\n",
    "* `boss_train.py`: for training, validating, and testing a CNN on boss image classification. "
